# TDbasedUFE_deconvolution
This is a set of sample source code to apply tensor decomposition based unsupervised feature extraction to Cellular deconvolution 

This is a set of sample source code of analyses performed in the following paper.
"Novel AI-based approach for cell type deconvolution in Visium datasets when reference scRNA-seqs include multiple minor cell types" by Y-h. Taguchi and Turki Turki

It includes not only the R source code to apply TD based unsupervised FE to deconvolution, but also that and Python code to perform four conventional methods, RCTD, SPOTlight, SpaCET, and cell2location. 

Sample.R: to perform TD based unsupervised FE, RCTD, SPOTlight, SpaCET and pllotting code for the results of cell2location.
cellslocation1.py, cellslocation2.py, cellslocation3.py, cellslocation14.py: to perform cell2location.

Good Luck!
